After 34 hours, asssuming I started from September 3rd (today's September 13th, 2021) I am giving up the personal touch section for now.
Well, I mean I did make it possible to change background theme, just that every time you reload or go to a new page, the background theme is back on default.
Freaking frustrating but whatever, I'll come back to it later maybe, so damn hard to make the system remember theme, I thought about session, local storage,
database (oh damn, that's actually probably feasible, albeit not as elegant I guess), and other stuff. It's just that combining JavaScript, HTML and Python
and all seems like a mystery.
(Without the personal touch I got it done in like 24 hours I think)
(Original idea was to slap a bootstrap theme onto it, and make it possible to switch, but there were like interferences because parts of the CSS were like
already defined and stuff, idk man. But I guess the simple theme changes I have look good enough)
